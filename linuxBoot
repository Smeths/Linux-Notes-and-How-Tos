Linux boot stages:

BIOS  - Basic input output system
1) Sytem integrity checks
2) Searches loads and executes the boot loader program (MBR)
3) Searches for drives

MBR - Master boot record
1) located in the first sector of the bootable disk
2) 512 bytes in size
3) Has 3 components:
a) Primary boot loader info
b) Partition table info
c) Mbr validation check
4) Contains information about GRUB - loads and executes the GRUB boot loader

GRUB - Grant unified boot loader
1) Can choose which kernel image to be executed
2) Displays splash screen and waits for a few seconds - then loads default kernel as specified in GRUB config file
3) GRUB has knowledge of the file system
4) GRUB loads kernel and initial ram disk init rd (the kernel uses the init rd)

Kernel

1) Mounts the root file system
2) Kernel executes program in it's init bin folder /sbin/init
This becomes the very first program to be executed process 0

Init

1) looks at linux /etc/inittab file to decide the run level
run levels decides which programs will be loaded at start up
The following run levels are available:
0-halt /etc/rc.d/rc0.d/ e.g.
1-single user mode
2-multiuser, without NFS
3-full multiuser mode
4-unused
5-X11
6-reboot

programs starting with "s" are used during startup, programs starting with "k" are used during shutdown
numbers next to program indicate when they should be started or killed

# Installing Arch Linux

## Downloading and Burning ISO on a Pen Drive

[Arch Linux can be downloaded from here](https://www.archlinux.org/download/)

!! could look into torrent download methods

The iso image "archlinux-2020.02.01-x86_64.iso" can be burnt to a pen drive using the linux
dd command. 

if == input file
of == output file
usage example:
$ sudo dd status=progress if=name-of.iso of=/dev/sdb <- depends on system

However, the "of" needs to be established first. This can be done by listing block devices.

lsblk

On my system this gave the following output:

NAME         MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sda            8:0    1  7.3G  0 disk /media/smeths/distro
mmcblk0      179:0    0 29.1G  0 disk 
└─mmcblk0p1  179:1    0 29.1G  0 part /
mmcblk0boot0 179:8    0    4M  1 disk 
mmcblk0boot1 179:16   0    4M  1 disk 

Before using the dd command the device must be umounted: umount /dev/sda. The command
"lsblk" now gives

NAME         MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sda            8:0    1  7.3G  0 disk 
mmcblk0      179:0    0 29.1G  0 disk 
└─mmcblk0p1  179:1    0 29.1G  0 part /
mmcblk0boot0 179:8    0    4M  1 disk 
mmcblk0boot1 179:16   0    4M  1 disk 

The dd command can now be used to burn the iso to the pen drive.

# Set up BIOS 

Make sure that the "USB Boot" is enabled and that USB is before OS (operating system) in the boot order

Then insert the pen drive and restart.

# Setting up the internet

When you restart the your computer should start from the usb drive and will boot arch linux from there.
You **cannot** simply install arch linux by selecting it, at this stage, and following a set of instructions.

The USB boot version of Arch Linux needed - for me - configuring before I could access the internet using
"ping". 

As I have a wireless connection I used followed [the instructions here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Network_configuration/Wireless)

The command "ip link" displays all of the internet interfaces. The lo interface is the "loopback" interface,
which I think (need to do more research) deals with return messages. It is definitely not a 
physical interface wireless or wired. The remaining interfaces will either start with a "w" indicating they are
wireless or start eth0 indicating an ethernet card for a wired interface. For the interface to be "ready" there
must be UP within the angular brackets. Intially the first section within angular brackets readS
 <BROADCAST,MULTICAST>

To set the interface up type "ip link set 'interface name' up". The contents of the angular brackets now
changes to <NO-CARRIER, BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP>.

The instructions at the link mentioned above recommend checking the drivers for the interface are loaded.
Type "lspci -k", to list pci (lspci) driver (-k). There should be a network controller, which I found.

You can also check for firmware, which best I can tell is the same as drivers by typing "dmesg | grep firmware"

ROUGH:

ip link set wlan0 up - to setup up interface
# for wireless wpa encryption 
wpa_passphrase Smeths Tigercat77 > wpa.conf
wpa_supplicant -Dwext -iwlan0 -c/root/wpa.conf -B
# to set up ip address and routing table
dhclient -r
dhclient wlan0

# repeat above then follow this, I think problem before were because of wrong format for EFI partition
